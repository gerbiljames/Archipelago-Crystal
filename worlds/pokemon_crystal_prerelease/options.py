    Both "entrance" and "exit" are connection names of the form "REGION_A -> REGION_B".
    The "entrance" is the door walked through. The "exit" is the connection at the
    arrival side: its first region is where the player ends up.

    Direction "both" forces the reverse pairing too; "entrance" forces only one direction.
    Requires randomize_entrances to include the relevant categories.
